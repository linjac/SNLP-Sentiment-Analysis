# SNLP-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of the project is to create a model solving a classification tasks. The
model is build on a sentiment analysis of IMDB movie ratings, labelling the
reviews as being either positive or negative. The dataset [12] that will be used
for this project is composed of around 50 000 movie reviews as raw text (without
being processed) that have already been labeled (whether they were positive or
negative feedback). The methodology consists of data processing, followed by
comparing through evaluation three models: Bidirectional , LSTM and one
pretrained BERT model. For the first state of the art models we will use the
pre-processed data, whereas for the BERT model the WordPiece tokenizer will
aid in tokenization lemmatization of the tokens.
